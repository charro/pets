First of all, I have to say that I really enjoyed the development process with ASP.NET Core. I didn't try it before, but I found it very productive and straightforward, not to say that I was able to do everything from my Linux Mint powered laptop, seamlessly.

Only thing I found not so straightforward was creating a set of unit tests for the most basic functionalities. I tried all options (xUnit, NUnit, MsTest...) but it seemed a not so easy to achieve task without creating a Solution (something I didn't want because it would complicate a project that was already nice and simple), so I decided to make a very simple HTML+JQuery frontend instead to show all the functionalities of the API.
